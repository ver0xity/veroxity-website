				<h1 style="text-align:center"> Hardware </h1>
				<p> My main computer is a Custom PC, that I had someone else make, because I was nervous af. I recieved my computer on 19<sup>th</sup> May, 2022 and since then, it has been serving me well. I haven't done any significant hardware upgrades, but I did have to change my failing PSU recently (still don't know why the previous one decided to fail lol) and added 2 fans for a better look. </p>

				<p> Now there are some mods that I have done. These include: </p>
			
				<ul>

					<li> Removing the front panel on the PC case, for a cleaner look and better intake.
										
					<li> Lubing my cheap mechanical keyboard.

					<li> Replacing the power button on my PC case with an old lock mechanism, similar to that of a car ignition switch.

				</ul>

				<h1 style="text-align:center"> Software </h1>
				<dl>
					<dt> Operating System </dt>
					<dd> I use Arch Linux, which is a simple, minimal GNU/Linux distribution.</dd>
					
					<br>

					<dt> Terminal </dt>
					<dd> I use the 'Alacritty' terminal. It's simple, fast, and gets the job done. </dd>

					
					<br>
					
					<dt> Shell </dt>
					<dd> I have recently started to use the <em>'zsh'</em> shell. And to be honest, I can't tell much of a difference from bash, other than the fact that it is extremely easy and intuitive to clear your history. </dd>
				
					<br>

					<dt> Desktop Enviornmnet/Window Manager </dt>
					<dd> I am currently using Hyprland. It is a wayland based window manager and it has all the eye candy and features you would want, whilst being extremely lightweight. </dd>

					<br>
					
					<dt> Code Editor </dt>
					<dd> I <em>rarely</em> code. But when I do, I use Vim. Vim is perfect for a beginner programmer like me, who doesn't need all the features that Vim has to offer. And so I don't really need to learn anything about it. Meaning the hard part is out of the way. AND I get to have insane bragging rights, whilst not even knowing the basics >.< <br>Though I do plan on learning it someday, just not now...</dd>

					<br>

					<dt> Web browser </dt>
					<dd> I use Firefox with uBlock Origin and mtab. Nothing fancy. Now, I have tried to give terminal browsers a shot, but I quickly realised that they are not for me, yet. </dd>

					<br>
					
					<dt> File Manager </dt>
					<dd> I mainly use 'Nemo'. But for some reason when I double click a compressed file, 'Gnome Files' opens and extracts it by itself. I still don't know why that is, but I am okay with that.<br> Or maybe not completely okay as for some reason, the Gnome Files app won't follow my system gtk and/or qt theme :(
						<br>Apart from these, I also sometimes use 'lf', which is terminal based. I use it when I am in a terminal, and am feeling too lazy to hit a shortcut on my keyboard.</dd>
					
					<br>

					<dt> Media Player </dt>
					<dd> I use either VLC or MPV. For me, VLC is going into a text file using your faviorite text editor, as you get a lot of functionality. On the other hand, MPV is like the <code>cat</code> command to have a quick glance at a file lol. </dd>

					<br>
					<dt> My desktop <em>rice(s)</em></dt>
					<dd> Sadly I don't have any pictures of the rices I used to rock earlier. But here is my current rice. The only thing different in the following pictures is the wallpaper. </dd>
